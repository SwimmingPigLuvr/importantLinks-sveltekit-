make sure that theme is saved to firestore
make sure that the html is using the user's saved theme as the theme, 
not the selected theme

if no theme saved or if not logged in => default theme

let user create their own theme
just create a color picker for primary, secondary...

let user change username


center links
let user upload custom links

finish video series



set link icons to images

figure out best way to integrate custom themes:
font choices, colors, etc, stored on a users database


appearance:

Profile:
div 
    PFP: pick an image / remove
    profile title: (default is @username)
    Bio:
    div
    + Add Social Icons
    /div

should i build the ui then figure out how to connect these variables to the backend?
yes i think so
should be hard. just like i created a way to save the users links. should be the same
they can be saved as:
lightTheme
darkTheme

userTheme:
    userbg
    userButton
    userButtonColor
    userButtonFont
    userButtonFontColor
    userButtonShadow: true/false
    userButtonShadowColor
    




TODO 7/29

think about architecture of the appearance settings

user should be able to amke changes everywhere after one click

they select primary, secondary, accent colors

fonts

then whereever those fonts are used the database is called to bring it in.

theme. let's first make sure that i can save the users theme then also call the users theme whereever neccessary
[username] & [username]/edit art the only ones so far.
let's see what it takes to make it load as fast as possible that way someone looking at your link site doesn't have to wait for the page to load

the theme picker works!
now i need to go back to all of my link styles and make sure that they follow the daisy ui
names: primary, secondary etc...

then once that is done i can create a page that lets the user pick each style individually. 
this will create a new theme and save it to the database: userTheme.

the prebuilt themes just use the name to determin styles becasue they are already built out
the userTheme will have to save each user selection

does this mean i will have to make a call from my database to the tailwind config file?
also each selection will have to trigger the corresponding css/tailwind classes to be defined

list of customizations
bg
font, font color
button color, button corners,

UX choice:
finish login, choose theme, go to profile page/link page

more ux:
choose themes:
list the same themes from before.
this time with previews:
preview is a smartphone shaped div 
with a background 
and 3 horizontal divs to resemble links

changes are saved as they are clicked.
database makes realtime updates

8.03

linktrees ui is great so i will use that as my wireframe



august 15 todo

âœ…fix edit profile h1 height on edit page so that when user clicks edit the pfp stays in the same place
ðŸ¤”change the bottom margin of the bio for the same reason

make bio and pfp editable from edit page

edit page doesn't use customBG
edit page loses theme completely

appearance page loses theme and links after reload

buttonFontColor is something to fix

footer covers content

finished
âœ… --cant scroll links. they just deadend--
