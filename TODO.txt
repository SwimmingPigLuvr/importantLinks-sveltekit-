make sure that theme is saved to firestore
make sure that the html is using the user's saved theme as the theme, 
not the selected theme

if no theme saved or if not logged in => default theme

let user create their own theme
just create a color picker for primary, secondary...

let user change username


center links
let user upload custom links

finish video series



set link icons to images

figure out best way to integrate custom themes:
font choices, colors, etc, stored on a users database


appearance:

Profile:
div 
    PFP: pick an image / remove
    profile title: (default is @username)
    Bio:
    div
    + Add Social Icons

should i build the ui then figure out how to connect these variables to the backend?
yes i think so
should be hard. just like i created a way to save the users links. should be the same
they can be saved as:
lightTheme
darkTheme

userTheme:
    userbg
    userButton
    userButtonColor
    userButtonFont
    userButtonFontColor
    userButtonShadow: true/false
    userButtonShadowColor
