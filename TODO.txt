make sure that theme is saved to firestore


















make sure that the html is using the user's saved theme as the theme, 
not the selected theme

if no theme saved or if not logged in => default theme

let user create their own theme
just create a color picker for primary, secondary...

let user change username


center links
let user upload custom links

finish video series



set link icons to images

figure out best way to integrate custom themes:
font choices, colors, etc, stored on a users database


appearance:

Profile:
div 
    PFP: pick an image / remove
    profile title: (default is @username)
    Bio:
    div
    + Add Social Icons
    /div

should i build the ui then figure out how to connect these variables to the backend?
yes i think so
should be hard. just like i created a way to save the users links. should be the same
they can be saved as:
lightTheme
darkTheme

userTheme:
    userbg
    userButton
    userButtonColor
    userButtonFont
    userButtonFontColor
    userButtonShadow: true/false
    userButtonShadowColor
    




TODO 7/29

think about architecture of the appearance settings

user should be able to amke changes everywhere after one click

they select primary, secondary, accent colors

fonts

then whereever those fonts are used the database is called to bring it in.

theme. let's first make sure that i can save the users theme then also call the users theme whereever neccessary
[username] & [username]/edit art the only ones so far.
let's see what it takes to make it load as fast as possible that way someone looking at your link site doesn't have to wait for the page to load

the theme picker works!
now i need to go back to all of my link styles and make sure that they follow the daisy ui
names: primary, secondary etc...

then once that is done i can create a page that lets the user pick each style individually. 
this will create a new theme and save it to the database: userTheme.

the prebuilt themes just use the name to determin styles becasue they are already built out
the userTheme will have to save each user selection

does this mean i will have to make a call from my database to the tailwind config file?
also each selection will have to trigger the corresponding css/tailwind classes to be defined

list of customizations
bg
font, font color
button color, button corners,

UX choice:
finish login, choose theme, go to profile page/link page

more ux:
choose themes:
list the same themes from before.
this time with previews:
preview is a smartphone shaped div 
with a background 
and 3 horizontal divs to resemble links

changes are saved as they are clicked.
database makes realtime updates

8.03

make an appearance page.

linktrees ui is great so i will use that as my wireframe



august 15 todo

✅fix edit profile h1 height on edit page so that when user clicks edit the pfp stays in the same place
🤔change the bottom margin of the bio for the same reason

username page has worse defualt bg than edit page

make bio and pfp editable from edit page

edit page doesn't use customBG
edit page loses theme completely

appearance page loses theme and links after reload

buttonFontColor is something to fix

footer covers content

live preview needs to be reactive to instant changes


finished

ideas

anymessage shjouldnt be annoyingh at all! thats the opposite of helpful
should have a nerd emoji giving tips

have remilio giving anouncements. anything with more authority really

still have to figure out how to stop propogation on the links on the edit page!

the button needs to be redesigned anyways so 
i think that it should just take up the whole right side of the link. 
maybe square shaped and a little trash emoji



friday august 18 755 am

add loading animations

new idea: complete customization. users can have links be any kind of shape or size

destroyed tasks
✅dnd Message shouldn't be so wide

✅adding delete button to the sortable list component 
✅so that i can use the index to determine the exact link to delete

✅ --cant scroll links. they just deadend--


focused tasks
links load in 1 at a time. 
i used to know how to do this idk where the solution went 
but its al ot more simpler that the ones ive been seeeing

🌸
august 19

goal:
    create a working store for the users themes


🪴example from docs
    <script>
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

  const count = writable(0);
  console.log($count); // logs 0

  count.set(1);
  console.log($count); // logs 1

  $count = 2;
  console.log($count); // logs 2
</script>


why? 
    instant reactive changes. 
    consistent easily called customizations across pages

how:
    get data into store from db, 
    call store from anywhere in project



✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅

NEW FOCUS

figure out the best way to make a store and go from there! 
eliminate redundant code 

so far the users first page works the best!
find out why and use that why!

🌸
august 21

figure out what i figured out from yesterday
why how why

figure out whats breaking and why

😂
also make sure that when a user wants to sign in on mobile they can. it gets all fucced up when it opens a google sign in


🌸critical mission: fix theme

so rn i have updatetheme called on homepage

update theme sets the themeStore to custom theme

so now the customtheme lives on the theme store

so now i should use the themestore to style values

🗣
goal to make everything easily customizable

but not too complicated

should i have the theme store in my livepreview? or in my appearance page??
both i think yeah

figure out how to upload a new pfp from the edit page?

also why the f is the edit page using a weird theme

lets get down to the bottom of this


august 22

see where its fucked up
fix that
then ui

🌸 APP TODO LIST 🌸
✅ edit profile theme needs to work
✅nav bar: quicker, made into a component, text size
✅nav bar: home. edit. appearance.
✅if on page then the nav should reflect that: dimmer text color

✅livepreview should reflect a real live preview
    set up store same way that the other files have it
        ✅data loaded in properly
            variables set up properly
                lets set up divs to test? wait is this really the best way

        question? should i set up the userdata for live preview? or just pass it in as props?
        lets find out shall we
    ???

update outline border styles


maybe different nav solution for the appearance page. 
    let's see how well it fits in


preload edit page so there is no lag at the begining

enhanced customizating (see list below)

theme should take over custom options

fix:
upload pfp 
upload bg 
gradients

ui todo list:
center link titles
link shadows are too big
edit:
    move edit bio button to the side
livepreview:
     should animate in on fullscreen



enhanced customization
composition: links locations
content: videos, blog posts

hover settings.
    default is currently translate to the right and down a bit
    color changes
    show preview
    each link has a color id that changes the background on hover
link size and shape.
shadow color, size, grow on hover
border color, size, grow on hover
custom cursor


idea:
to get ready for all of these new customization features that i want to add
i should extend CustomTheme
already i have hex codes that should be added





short todo

fontcolor colorpicker is opening the button color picker
it still works it just exists above

live preview doesnt yet show the font color. 
maybe the div that live preview is in can just be the font color so i dont have to pass the data (lazy)

but if this doesn't result in a reactive change then let's just pass the data


weird minor detail bug?

on appearance page the theme of the page changes to default when refreshed.

but the live preview stays on the correct theme



✅head to uselink and figure out how to center the titles
ducktape bandaid solution: -translate-x-6

✅prebuilt theme doesn't properly apply to homepage



✅homepage isnt reactive because its not using the store the same way that edit page is using $userData



need to resolve the footer

need to have credit but also direct user to create their own if theyre not logged in


should be able to see other users content without being logged in

description of the error 
i can only be signed in under @Remilio
once signed in i can user any other users username as a route 
localhost/PeterGriffin just shows me remilios data
but if im logged in as PeterGriffin then i cant see anything


somehow i broke it

probably the userstore only accepts remilio as data but the app should be able to pull any users' data
the only thing that you have to be logged in for is editing the data: edit, appearance


august 22 6:13pm

planning each step so i can organize how i think about the code:

✅{right now the link title is shifted to the left. 
this centers it perfectly 
but in the live preview it goes too far

i need to find the state that is passed into userlink that lets it know that it is in preview mode
then i need to make sure the style is cahanged for the little mini baby links}✅



themes only work if there is no custom theme value
prebuilt themes are the fallback

tell the user that themes are fallbacks 

or we can take into consideration that themes weigh more than custom themes
let the user save a custom theme



main user page has no set theme
fallsback to default theme

last selection first
current theme goes

theme -> custombuttons => theme + customButtons
custombuttons -> theme => theme

how do we go about this?

certain bg colors dont cover screen weird



important tasks
fix auth buggy wigyyy



dnd message feels weird



focus

todo
get data from the user that is in the route

example if user is on yin.yang/PeterGriffin then we use that to get the data
update the $themeStore with that

make sure edit only is available to signed in users
edit only if (user is signed in && user matches yin.yang/username)


lets see how i got that page param in the nav

import page from $app/svelte

// on yin.yang/remilio

console.log('$page.params.username: ', $page.params.username); === [username]
then updates the $userData store 
with all of the data from that users db

nav to edit / appearance only if logged in



add glow effects

fullscreen preview on hover would be sick

new section:
text effects
tracking


create a toggle to choose hover on text effects

hover effects: rotate? clock animation thing real old school style
the css possibilities are endless


august 23:
focus

is anything broken??

or can i just start throwing in styles?

I should really expand on the CustomTheme type

so that i can easily add it to my data

so my ui focues should be the userlink component styles


todoList
Create toggle for text styles:
    hover / static
    on:clicking the text style should default to static
    ✅this should trigger a handler function that saves into the db
    what info do i need to know?
        textEffect: {effect: string, onHover: boolean}
    should toggle only appear on chosen style?
        {#if customTheme.textEffect === buttonId}

change data structure:

right now we have

customTheme = {
    background: string,
    buttonColor: string,
    buttonFontColor: string,
    buttonStyle: string,
    font: string,
    fontColor: string,
    textEffect: {
        effect: string,
        onHover: false,
    }
}

this is weird. i should make it consistent 
exactly how i did textEffect

export interface CustomTheme {
  background: {
    style: 'image' | 'gradient' | 'solid',
    value: string
  };
  button: {
    style: | "squareFill"
    | "roundFill"
    | "circleFill"
    | "squareOutline"
    | "roundOutline"
    | "circleOutline"
    | "squareShadow"
    | "roundShadow"
    | "circleShadow",
    color: string,
    fontColor: string,
    textEffect: {
      effect: 'none' | 'glow' | 'gradient' | 'highlight',
      onHover: boolean
    }
  };
  font: {
    family: string,
    color: string,
  }
}

export const defaultTheme: CustomTheme = {
  background: {
    style: 'solid',
    value: 'accent'
  },
  button: {
    style: 'circleFill',
    color: 'primary',
    fontColor: 'primary-content',
    textEffect: {
      effect: 'none',
      onHover: false
    }
  },
  font: {
    family: 'input-mono',
    color: 'black'
  }
};

this seems like a lot but it's actually way simpler

now i have a type: CustomTheme that contains 3 objects:
background
button
and font

ez

todo right now
make sure to persist changes throughout project

um i think i got it right so far i think i have to update the way the data is taken
on the [username] page its funky
[username]/edit works perfectly because all of the changes show instantly in the store and in the db




ui notes

"edit profile"
should transition in because the pages are almost identical



ui fixes are secondary
ui changes / experiments are supplemental, low priority

however they are all important to jot down so i can get to it later
ui fix:
appearacne page live preview:
    weird padding on Filled buttons and shadow buttons:
        its because there is no border. so the padding is thrown off

    changing the theme causes the following changes:
        fontcolor: buttons and normal text have the same color
        outline + shadow colors

    solutions

        add padding to style that dont have borders
        actually no! just add invisible border becasue the issue appears on normal mode userlinks
        its just harder to see becasue the buttons are much bigger
    
        apply the fontColorHex to livePreview / UserLink, depending on where the break is
        same with buttonCOlorHex!




macro steps:

fix app
host on server with domain: yin.yang? lol something easy / catchy etc / 
    net themes? tech
    .tech? .io? .com
let people sign up / test


current todo: fixing the homepage

upon console logging the customTheme data is correct

now i have to apply it correctly
on the page i have to fix how background is applied
and how font is applied

then for the links
im going to pass in customTheme as a prop
and clean up the other props

old export let 100 different items 🤮
new export let 1 object with 100 items 😎


cleaning up rn

✅putting the convert function in a file so i dont have to type it multiple times across files

figure out where i left off:

applying the styles correctly?

now that im passing the whole customTHeme object then i dont need the link styles on my main page


somehow i broke everything again

only certain settings are reactive on the edit page

nothing is reactive in the home page



todo

up date the appearance page to save everythign correctly:
use the new custom theme as the model


stop passing unneccessary props

just like we cleaned up the props for uselink we should clean up the props for
livepreview

live preview needs

userinfo: username, bio, pfp, links
userTheme: bg, font, customTheme object

props: bg, bio, username, pfp, customtheme


wait lets no do too much
live preview only needs customtheme becasue userlink nneds customtheme

it doesn't do anything

oh actiually it does bg adn fonts



whenever im kinda floating looking for an error to tackle
checiklist

terminal errors?
console.log errors?
intellisence errors?

in no particular order

also writing down what im ddoing helps

sets my intention

one thing at a time baby

current:
 
terminal:
nothing
intellisence:
nothing
console:
UserLink is breaking the homePage
cant read properties of undefined 'effect':

effect has to exist in the first place

if customTheme && customTheme.button && customTheme.button.textEffect?


fixed an error without gpt

how i just did thats how


unneccessary props passed in livepreview

undefined 'font' breaking livepreview


not sure if everyhting makes it into the live prewview after being passed in 
so i might as well use the store to get it

need to save everything as the correct CustomTHeme type in my db

so lets het to appearance and update asll these save functions

also update the save functions in the colorpicker component

spent a lot of time on one const value 
so now i need to touch base again to see whats next

update all functions

colorpicker is just dealing with colors so i dont have to listen to chatgpt

carefule becasue now wehn i save the default datatosave that i used is saved everytime

so lets use the userData in the default data to save. only the new cahgnes will override

FOCUS
implement changes slowly to see how they change my project
one brick at a time. deliberatley placed

ui comments


✅can't see the text on addLink form: 
    from what i remember it's using the users theme
    but it is also using the user's font
    so has to be one or the other not both
        findings:
            not using the users theme, just using the default theme: 'red'
        solution:
            ✅use the user's fontCOlor for bg
            ✅and the bg for the font color
            ✅that way there's no way that it clashes
                unless the user chooses a font that they can't see
                boom now the problem is put on them haha checkmate😎

✅saving colors
    have to make sure that just the colors are saved and 
    that it isn't changing everything to the placeholder theme im passing into the function

    findings: 
        i am using a default custom theme 
        just so the intellisence errors dont yell at me

    solution:
        take customTheme as a prop
        update save functions to take customTHeme as an argument

        how to implement solution:
            ✅1 have customTHeme defined in username/edit/appearance as the user's custom theme: data.customTheme (however data is defined) 
            2 pass customTHeme into all instances of the colorpicker component

        how to test each step:
            ✅1 consolelog customTheme so i know that it is the correct theme and that is is congruent with the settings in their dbo

        testing:
            i watn to be very procedural so that i dont have to go back and figure out what went wrong
            now that everything looks good i can start saving colors and see how they update the customTheme

            check:
                db and customTheme to see if they are equal

        BOOM it works that was eassy haha
        easy when i know what to do
        i know what to do when i understand how everything works a little more
        lesson: 
        it's good to ask questions
        if i know how my tools work i know how to use them
        and when to use them
            good questions:
                What is this doing?
                Why is this doing this?
                

appearance page:
    current choices need to reflect the current choice that is saved in the user's db
    right now it is blank until the user makes a new choice
    that's probably because the color value is coming from ???
    
    solution;
        use the db to set the value: customTheme.(correct value)  o   

theme fallback
    preset theme should be the fallback if there is no customTheme value
    solution: 
        data-theme={data.theme} 
        bg-{background? background : 'primary'} in the body of everypage


    findings
        accent>
        appearacne page:
            currently uses a theme value for the phone bg
            but it doesn't use the customTHeme background

            solution:
                make sure it does those things

            how: 
                find out if this is a livepreview issue or appearance page issue
                probably livePreview issue

            okay i guess i got it to work but
            the livePreview isn't reactive! thats the whol point to see the changes instantly

            make it reactive!
            edit page is reactive so copy how they did it there 
            ask the team in cahrge of the edit page how they did it

            edit page reactivity

            bg ✅
            fontColor ✅
            font ❌
            buttonstyle ❌
            buttoncolor ❌
            buttonFontColor ❌

reminder of where im at:
trying to get the site consistent and make sure everything works that's it
once it's cleaned up then i add more effects. host the site. then profit 😈

current tasks 
    get the edit page fully reactive
    use those methods to get live preview reactive
    save fonts correctly
    get teh pfp upload working correctly


    errors to address later:
        if viewing page that isn't the current signed in user:
            ✅username, pfp, bio work correctly
            breaks at userLink


jstu sat back down have ot remind myself of current task:
    check what makes the edit page bg reactive and apply that method as far as the eye can see


vim cmds to learn:
    ✅jump to bottom of file
        G
    ✅jump to top of file
        gg

edit page reactivity finginds
    background + fontColor + font works from:
    $: if ($userData) {
        customTHeme = $userData.customTheme;
        background = customTheme.background.value;
        fontCOlor = customTHeme.font.color;
        font = customTHeme.font.family;
    }

    font simply isnt saving



    another issue: font color preview div
    isn't showing the fontCOlor rip
    im using 
    style={`color: ${fontColorHex}`}

    ✅solved: 
        dont need to use the hex!
        just a normal tailwind class
        bg-{fontColor}

    going back to updating the font save

    noticed taht in the font component colorpicker is imported
    it was grayed out so i just deleted it
    just jotting this down incase

    i want to record all of the changes that i make so i can see what the heck im doing

    also deleted the handlefontcolor select
    the font component jsut saves the font

    hmmmmmmmmmm

    mental htinking note
    just a thought

    since font component is cosmetic
    maybe i should just have all of the save functions in a saveFunctions.ts file?????????
    thinking emoji


    i changed the shape of what the fontsavve function does
    from:
    customTHeme: {
        font: chosenfont
    }
    to:
    customTHeme: {
        font: {
            fontfamily: chosenFont
        }
    }




issue note notice issue that i noticed:

elven doesnt display correctly on the font dropdown but i know for a fakt that 'font-elven' works as a tailwind class so i must go back and fix this
elven is a very important font to my users

font now svaes correctly



edit page reactivity

            bg ✅
            fontColor ✅
            font ✅
            buttonstyle ❌
            buttoncolor ❌
            buttonFontColor ❌


now lets get to the bottom of these buttons being unreactive

right now buttonstyles are coming from the customTHeme.button.style

so i guess its breaking un the userlink because userlink takes customtheme and customtheme seems to be A okay




side note ui thingy

text too big on livepreview in preview mode


$$$

changed

if (something) {
    something
}

to

$: if (something) {
    something way better and cooler
}

button font color saves perfectly in the db
but isnt reflective nor does it reflect in the edit page at all

lets see how incorrectly userlink is using it


error:
    i was doing 
    if (buttoncolor && buttonfontColor) {
        tailwind to hex conversions
    }

    but i should've jsut had the tailwind hex conversions in 
    $: if (customTHeme && customTHeme.button) {
        tailwind hex converters

major w


now that edit page is reactive lets check on the livepreview

livepreview reactivity:

            bg ❌
            fontColor ❌
            font ❌
            buttonstyle ✅
            buttoncolor ✅
            buttonFontColor ✅  


steps
bg
    bg-{bg? bg : 'secondary'} is going to secondary
    so maybe its an issue with how background is 

changing:
    if (customTheme) {
        background = customTheme.background.value;
        font = customTheme.font.family;
        fontColor = customTheme.font.color;
    } 

    to:
        background = customTheme.background.value;
        font = customTheme.font.family;
        fontColor = customTheme.font.color;

results:

    it works: it shows the correct bg but then it breaks the pages
    lets see whats wrong:

    terminal error:
        Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'background')
        at eval (/Users/dylannevell/dev/fireship/svelte/myapp/src/lib/components/LivePreview.svelte:30:27)

        i think i have to wrap the change i made in an if statement


        yup

        i chagned the change early by taking off the if block completely
        but i shoulda jsut added some reactiviy
        just a sprinkly of 
        $: if (something) {
            somtehing really cool
        }

livepreview reactivity:

            bg ✅
            fontColor ✅
            font ✅
            buttonstyle ✅
            buttoncolor ✅
            buttonFontColor ✅  


new vim cmd:
change all instances after cursor

:.,$s/old/new/g

. === current line
$ === end of file





✅current todo currently

make sure the current colors are upto date on the colorpicker

i was ableto fix this by making sure that backgorund was up to date

but!

the div changes based on the current mode

so i have to conditionally apply the style based on the mode

wish me luck...luck! ok thanks

more notes:

transition into the fullscreen live preview

fix the pfp upload
add gradients
image bg will be kooool

edit links in one at a time


8.25.23
✅first mission: image backgrounds
    function looks clean:
        next step:
            set up form and functions correctly to handle upload
            login/photo has the form out already
            but appearance page should only show form when selected

        update db target
        customTheme.background.style && .value

    console error:
        Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'family')
        at $$self.$$.update (LivePreview.svelte:26:29)

        investigaate: 

        UserLink.svelte:39 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'textEffect') userlink line 39

        everytime i fix one. another pops up
        i guess i have to ask like this
            if (customTheme?.background)

            lets see if this fixes everything


            background image function deletes everything


second mission: text effects

main background mission: dont overdesign.
    get site hosted

fullscreen live preview transitions in!
    phone preview is already mounted so i have to make sure that:
        not mounted when screen size is small
        clicking the preview button 👀 mounts it
gradient options
    :save choice 1 then choice 2?
    or different color choice flow?
        style with tailwind to hex conversions
    once i do that i can figure out where else to add gradients?
    buttons? oiutlines? shadows
handle image backgrounds
    let user select positions
        cover / contain / stretch
    let user select styles
        brightness? contrast? opacity? color filter?
hover link changes bg?
    color preview: glowing? content preview?
links shifted to the right on large breakpoint
    content preview on the left

saving new styles as data objects
    updating CustomTheme interface
color picker 
    preview divs on top of colorpicker
resolve dnd message positioning
    daisy ui presets have good options
    find good placement
    use cookies to only show message 1x/day (any more than taht is annoying)
let user create and save themes
choosing preset themes should overwrite all customizations
let user know 
    when they have to be signed in to view something
    edit page: cant edit someone elses page
once everything is kosher
    move all functions into saveFunctions.ts:
        saveFunctions, colorpicker, image uploads
        the best components dont have redundant functions found in other files


side quests:
    practice typing
        accuracy > speed
    learn new vim cmds
        make workflow faster => make life easier

        jump up to line that i want without having to use trackpad
            number of lines + j / k (too long to count lines)
            something quicker:
                figure it out

            choose second option from intellisence

    weird error under (doc(db, "users", $user!.uid), { photoURL: url})
    maybe use bakgtics
    doc(db, `users/${$user!.uid}`)
        this gets rid of the error message but let's see if it breaks anything?
        no breaks yet! i think it's complete
        so before i add anohter function to upload the bg lets fix the others


    cleanup unused imports they're all over this place


    await updateDoc(doc(db, `users/${$user!.uid}`), { photoURL: url })
    this saves to user.photoURL

    but for the background let's save to 
        await updateDoc(doc(db, `users/${$user!.uid}`), { backgorund: style: 'image', value: url })



fixed everything by changing the save fucntion to write bacth instead of update Doc


now make sure that userbg shows in the page


conditionally apply the bg based on the style

ill need to use <style> instead of tailwind class for gradient
and possible the image


upload functions workt

styles are applied correctyl

now need to use positioning styles:
    prompt user to select position
    save selection as new data field background: { style: image, value: url, position: 'fit' | 'cover' | 'contain' | '...etc' }
    update the custom theme
    make sure new saving functions don't mess everything up
    then make sure to set vars
    let backgroundPosition = customTheme.background.position;


just throwing in the bg doesn't look cool at all. default should be 100% 100%


positioning of the bg selector is off

also change the previews for the color picker to be on top of the collors


session 2
august 25 6PM

save customThemes

input theme name
saveTheme button => calls saveCustomTheme(name: string, customTheme: CustomTheme)

customTheme shows at front of themes array



this sumple function saves a new customTheme with a name

async function saveCustomTheme(name: string, customTheme: CustomTheme) {
    console.log('saving customTheme: ', name + ': ', + customTheme);

    const batch = writeBatch(db);
    batch.set(doc(db, `users/${$user!.uid}`), {
      [name]: customTheme
    }, { merge: true });

    await batch.commit();
  }


  im going to edit it to save into an array

  now im going to populate the themes arrary with these data.userthemes[]
